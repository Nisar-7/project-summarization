# project-summarization
This project fine-tunes the pretrained bert-base-uncased transformer on the arXiv dataset for abstractive summarization of scientific papers. Leveraging Hugging Faceâ€™s Trainer and TrainingArguments, it provides an efficient, scalable pipeline with BERT tokenizer for generating clear, concise summaries.
